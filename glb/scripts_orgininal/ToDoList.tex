\section*{TODO List}

\emph{Writing}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Justify queueing delay.
	\item Justify $\beta$.
	\item Justify shifting workloads. Should we add the delay bound.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Data analysis}

\begin{itemize}
	\item It is hard to predict renewable energy. However, electricity prices can be more predictable. Double check this argument!
	\item Add the features (or possibly seasonality) to predict PV , Wind, and electricity prices. (weather, time)
	\item Workload ~ what can impact on the workload? weekly patterns? what's else?
\end{itemize}

\emph{Simulation.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Debug the poor performance gap. How: (1) $\beta=0$. (2) use different error distributions for different places.
	\item Vary $\beta$
	\item Vary the ratios of long-term prices/real-time prices.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Concerned questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why don't we predict and purchase energy for a longer time slot?
\end{itemize}
