\subsection{Model}
\label{change.model}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item We can define the workload power demand $d^r_i = d(\lambda_i)$ where $d(.)$ is a convex function. Then, try to go over again the theoretical analysis.
	\item We may try with the objective function that only has the energy cost.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Algorithms}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Think of what people do in reality: They may only optimize the energy cost.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Predictability Analysis}

\subsection{Case Studies}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item May we add a picture that shows the impact of long-term prices on the traditional algorithms and the proposed algorithms?
\end{enumerate}
