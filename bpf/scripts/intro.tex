\section{Introduction}

%% introduce the workload based on Google cluster data.
Cloud computing workload introduction: batch jobs and production jobs. Jobs are classified into multiple scheduling classes.

%%
Introduce multiple goals: performance and fairness.

%% Motivation example
Motivation example: strictly ensuring performance hurts fairness and vise versa.

%% 
Highlight our focus like Figure \ref{fig:Design-Space}: long-term fairness plus bounded priority.

Introduce high level of challenges:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] fairness and performance do not co-exist.
	\item[2.] Multiclasses of priorities.
\end{itemize}

Summarize the contributions:

\paragraph{Algorithm Design}

\paragraph{System Design}

\paragraph{Evaluation based both testbed experiments and large scale simulations}
