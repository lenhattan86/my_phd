%In this section, we demonstrate the benefits of temporal co-scheduling of queues with heterogeneous performance metrics using an example to compare against existing solutions (Section~\ref{sec:ex}). 
%Next, we explore the desired properties and the design space for such a solution (Section~\ref{sec:desire}), followed by the discussion of challenges in achieving high \burstq utilization by admitting more {\burstq}s with resource guarantee.
% Our model and solution approach apply to a general class of resource allocation problems including those in the networking community (Section~\ref{sec:networking}) \todo{add}.

%While hard guarantee and instantaneous fairness are with fundamental tradeoffs, (Section~\ref{sec:desire})  and.  and inefficiencies in existing schedulers (Section~\ref{sec:desire}), and discusses the challenges associated (Section~\ref{sec:challenge}).

Consider the example in Figure~\ref{fig:motiv_ex} again. Recall that SP and DRF are two extreme cases in trading off performance and fairness: SP provides the best performance (for {\burstq}s) with no fairness consideration (for {\batchq}s); DRF ensures the best isolation (for {\batchq}s) with poor performance (of {\burstq}s). 
However, it is still possible for {\burstq}s and {\batchq}s to share the cluster by thoughtful co-scheduling over time.

The ideal allocation is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:motiv-optimal}. 
The key idea is ``bounded'' priority for {\burstq}s as we discuss in the previous section. 
In particular, before 1,400 seconds, \burstq's bursts are small, so it gets higher priority, which is similar to SP. 
After \burstq increases its demand, only a fraction of its demand can be satisfied with the entire system's resources. Then it has to give resources back to \batchq to ensure the long-term fairness.

%in IQs unless we set very high weights to IQs. Even in this case, there are at least two problems: (a) BQ starvation, (b) still no performance guarantee with multiple IQs because giving them all high weights does not work.

%DRF/HUG: similar to FS as only focusing on instantaneous allocation.

%\emph{Example Setup} 
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Framework: Tez atop YARN.
%\item Assumption: All the jobs are memory bound jobs so that it is equivalent to single resource allocation.
%\item cluster: 40 nodes. each node has 64 GB RAM.
%\item \burstq submits delay-sensitive jobs. \burstq submits 4 Map Reduce jobs every 600 secs. A Map task <14GB, 1 cpu> resource takes 25 secs and a Reduce task <20GB, 1 cpu> takes 2 secs.
%	\begin{itemize}
%	\item 2 first jobs have 480 Map tasks and 80 Reduce tasks. 
%	\item The 3rd and 4nd jobs have 1920 Map tasks and 320 Reduce tasks. 
%	\end{itemize} 
%\item \batchq submits the jobs generated from BigBench workload. The \batchq's jobs are queued up at the beginning.
%\end{itemize}

%In Figure \ref{fig:mov_example}, Strict allows \burstq to speeds up his jobs to as soon as possible. However, Strict hurts \batchq a lot when the delay-sensitive jobs are too large (from 1000).





%\subsection{Just to organize our own thoughts}


\input{scripts/properties}

%Techniques such as packing can help further increase ``good'' utilization. 
%Our current work is based on admission in an FCFS manner.

% We assume {\burstq}s submit their highest possible demand across bursts.
%\subsection{Challenge: uncertainties in an {\burstq}'s demand}
%
%If an {\burstq} knows the distribution, she can run a stochastic optimization to decide the parameters used in her request. \zhenhua{Do we have any data to support this?}
%
%If an {\burstq} has no knowledge or the distribution varies dramatically over time (such as Figure~\ref{fig:mov_example}), she needs to submit multiple requests over time by solving a (challenging) online problem.
