\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, %we study the problem of scheduling jobs over interchangeable resources to optimize performance while providing fairness among users sharing the cluster. 
we design and implement \name, a system that minimizes job completion time over CPU/GPU clusters based on Kubernetes while providing fairness among users and preventing starvation. 
\name profiles and schedules jobs in an automatic, online manner. Our algorithm solves a min-cost bipartite matching problem and obtains the corresponding placement and scheduling decisions. 
It provides a optimal solution in simplified settings and outperforms all baselines significantly in general settings. 
Evaluations highlight that \name can significantly improve system performance while maintaining fairness among users.  
The problem studied in this paper is a generalization of the traditional job scheduling and fair resource allocation problems, and can be applied beyond computational resources, e.g., to different network interfaces and storage devices. Extending the algorithmic study and system design to these resources is our ongoing work.
